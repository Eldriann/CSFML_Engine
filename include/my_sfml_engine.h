** All of the sub engines are run by the main engine.
** \section gameobject_sec Gameobjects
** \subsection intro_sec Introduction
** \ref my_sfml_gameobject are the core of a game.
** They represent all elements in a \ref scene.
** Refer to the \ref main_engine to know how to register one.
** A gameobject consist of a set of one or more \ref my_sfml_component.
** \subsection component_sec Components
** Components are small amount of data that serve for one job.
** Some are already builtin the engine like:
** \ref my_sfml_transform , \ref my_sfml_animation_2d ,\
** \ref my_sfml_collider_2d , \ref my_sfml_rigidbody_2d , \ref my_sfml_text ,\
**  \ref my_sfml_button [WIP].
** Other can be created as you need if you respect the norm given by
** \ref my_sfml_component
** \section owner_sec Owner
** This engine was created by Julian Fr√§bel on top of the CSFML library.
** It was created for the Graphical module of Epitech.
